# CorrijaAI

CorrijaAI is a **Flask**-based application that allows teachers to create and manage academic questions, while students can answer them. The responses are automatically evaluated through an integration with the **Gemini API** and sent back to the teacher.

The project features a **Flutter front-end** and a **Python back-end**, using **SQLite** as the database.
